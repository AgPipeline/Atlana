# Welcome to Atlana

Atlana is our web interface used to configure and run workflows for processing drone captured data.

## What's available
Aside from providing a convienient way for running workflows, we also provide:
- configure one or more storage locations at the folder and file levels
- download and restore configured storage locations
- run workflows
- create new workflows that use git repositories
- re-run jobs you've created and jobs others have created
- download and restore workflows you've created and workflows you've run

Downloaded storage locations and worflows are in JSON format and can be shared with others.
