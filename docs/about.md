# About Atlana

Our Agricultural Data Processing Pipeline, [AgPipeline](https://github.com/AgPipeline), is a powerful tool used to assemble and run workflows using drone-captured data.
The Altana project adds a browser-based interrface to this pipeline making it easier to modify and run processing workflows.
