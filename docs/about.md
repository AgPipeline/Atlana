# About Atlana

Our Agricultural Data Processing Pipeline [AgPipeline]](https://github.com/AgPipeline) is a powerful tool used to assemble and run workflows using drone-captured data.
The Altana project adds a browser-based interrface to this pipeline allowing the simplification of modifying and running processing workflows.
